The default python/pip installation on mac produces some issues when trying to run `pip install` here are some ways to fix it.

`sudo pip install`
`brew install python`
`pip install --ignore-installed <package you want>`
`sudo pip install --user <package you want>`

I would suggest reading this article before running any commands however if you are not sure what you are doing https://opensourcehacker.com/2012/09/16/recommended-way-for-sudo-free-installation-of-python-software-with-virtualenv/
